 Introduction to the basics of C++ OOP

## Products
 <br/>
   In this laboratory you will need to create a class named 'Product'. The 
   Product class should have 3 private 'components' : 'name' which will be 
   dinamically allocated, 'producer' which will also be dinamically allocated,
   'price' which will be a float variable. The methods of this class will be 
   public and you will need to have : both 'constructor' and 'copy constructor';   two 'modification' methods(first which will have two char variables and one 
   float variable as arguments, the second one which will have as argument a 
   Product class object); a destructor; getters and setters for every component.
